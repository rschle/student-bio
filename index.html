    <p>I was born in San Diego, but I go to school in Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I am a rising senior at Penn studying Economics and Chinese.
         In my freetime I like to bake, cook, workout, watch Netflix, and plank with the diabetic alert dog that my best friend is training.</p>
    <p>From the Econometrics course that I recently took this past semester, I gained experience in the statistical coding language R. Before this class I did not have much formal experience in other coding languages.
        However, I did spend part of one summer a couple years ago learning Python on code academy. I am definitely rusty.
